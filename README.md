# Analyzing Insights for Environmental Monitoring and Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing insights from environmental monitoring data using Python and MySQL. The dataset contains information such as device identifiers, timestamps, temperature, carbon monoxide levels, humidity levels, and other relevant parameters. By performing data preprocessing and SQL analysis, this project aims to derive valuable insights for environmental monitoring and analysis.

## Data Preprocessing Using Python

The data preprocessing phase involves the following tasks:

1. Renaming the Columns: Ensuring clear and consistent column names for better understanding.

2. Checking for Null Values: Identifying and handling any missing values within the dataset.

3. Removing Duplicates: Eliminating duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.

4. Handling Missing Values: Implementing appropriate techniques to handle missing data.

5. Data Type Conversion: Converting data types to ensure consistency and compatibility.

6. Exporting the Cleaned Dataset: Saving the processed dataset for further analysis.

## Analysis Using SQL

The SQL analysis phase encompasses the following tasks:

1. Finding the average temperature recorded for each device.

2. Retrieving the devices with the highest average carbon monoxide levels.

3. Calculating the average temperature recorded in the cleaned_environment table.

4. Finding the timestamp and temperature of the highest recorded temperature for each device.

5. Identifying devices where the temperature has increased from the minimum recorded temperature to the maximum recorded temperature.

6. Calculating the exponential moving average of temperature for each device.

7. Finding the timestamps and devices where carbon monoxide levels exceed the average carbon monoxide level of all devices.

8. Retrieving the devices with the highest average temperature recorded.

9. Calculating the average temperature for each hour of the day across all devices.

10. Identifying the device(s) in the cleaned_environment dataset that have recorded only a single distinct temperature value.

11. Finding the device with the highest humidity levels.

12. Calculating the average temperature for each device, excluding outliers (temperatures beyond 3 standard deviations).

13. Calculating the cumulative sum of temperature for each device.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the analysis of environmental monitoring data using Python and MySQL. By performing data preprocessing and utilizing SQL queries, valuable insights can be derived for environmental monitoring and analysis purposes. The provided tasks serve as a starting point for analyzing similar datasets in the field of environmental monitoring, enabling researchers and professionals to optimize environmental analysis and decision-making processes.
